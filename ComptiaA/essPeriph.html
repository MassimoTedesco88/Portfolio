				<h3>Thermal design power (TDP)</h3><p>is the maximum amount of heat a computer chip (like a CPU or GPU) is expected to generate undertypical workload conditions. It’s measured in watts and helps hardware designers choose appropriate cooling system to keep the chip operating safely and efficiently. (TDP is not the absolute maximum power the chip can use).</p>

				<p><b>Clock multipliers:</b> a clock multiplier is a factor used to determine the operating frequency of a CPU based on the base clock speed of the system.</p>
				<p>CPU speed = Base Clock x Multiplier</p>
				<p>3.6GHz = 100MHz x 36</p>
				<p><b>64-bit Processing:</b> refers to a CPU architecture that handles data in 64-bit chunks.</p> 
				<p>This allows for:</p>
   				<ul>
					<li>more memory access (up to 18.4 million TB of RAM theorically)</li>
					<li>better performance with large datasets</li> 
					<li>enhanced security features</li> 
   				</ul>
				<p><i>x86:</i> originally referred to Intel’s 32-bit processor architecture. Over time, it became a general label for 32-bit instruction set architectures used in PCs.</p>
				<p><i>x64:</i> 64-bit extension of x86.</p>
				<p><i>X86-64:</i>technical term for x64.</p>
				<p><b>Virtualization Support:</b> enables a CPU to run multiple operating systems simultaneously using virtual machines.</p>

				<p><b>Parallel Execution:</b> refers to the ability of a CPU to execute multiple instructions or tasks at the same time, rather  than one after another.</p>
				<p><i>Pipeling:</i> is a technique where the CPU breaks down instruction execution into separate <i>stages</i>, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously – one in each stage.</p>
				<p>This boosts instructions through put.</p>
				<p><i>Stages:</i></p>
				<ol>
					<li><i>Fetch:</i> get the data from the EDB</li>
					<li><i>Decode:</i> figure out what type of command needs to be executed</li>
					<li><i>Execute:</i> perform the calculation</li>
					<li><i>Write:</i> send the data back on to the EDB</li>
				</ol>
				<p><i>Cache:</i> is a small, fast memory inside or near the CPU that stores copies of frequently used data from the main memory (RAM), helping the CPU access important information much faster.</p>
				<p><i>Threads:</i> a thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a program.
				Multiple threads can run parts of a program at the same time, allowing tasks to happen faster and more efficiently.</p>
				<p><i>Wait states:</i> a wait state is a short delay that occurs when the CPU has to wait for data from slower devices like RAM or storage.
				While waiting, the CPU temporarily pauses because it cannot continue processing without the required information.</p>
				<p>L1, L2, L3 Cache</p>
				<ul><li>L1 Cache: Smallest and fastest cache, built directly into the CPU core. Stores critical data and instructions needed immediately.</li> 
					<li>L2 Cache: Larger than L1 Cache but a bit slower. Acts as a backup for L1, holding more data.</li>
					<li>L3 Cache: Even larger and slower compared to L1 and L2. Shared across multiple cores to improve communication between them.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><i>Multithreading:</i> is the general concept where a CPU( or a program) handles multiple threads at the same time to improve performance.</p>
				<p><i>Hyper-Threading:</i> is Intel’s brand name for a special type of multithreading where one physical CPU core acts like two logical cores. It lets a single core process two threads simultaneously to better use CPU resources and increase speed.</p>
				<p><b>Multicore processing:</b> means a CPU has two or more independent cores inside a single chip. Each core can run its own tasks or threads at the same time, which makes the CPU much faster and better at multitasking compared ti a single-core processor.</p>
				<p><b>Integrated memory controller (IMC):</b> is a memory controller that is built directly into the CPU instead of being a separate chip on the motherboard.
It manages communication between the CPU and the system’s RAM, making data transfer faster and more efficient by reducing latency.</p>
				<p><b>Integrated graphics processing unit (iGPU):</b> is a graphics processor built into the CPU (or sometimes into the motherboard chipset). It handles basic graphics tasks like video playback, webbrowsing, and light gaming without needing a separate (dedicated) graphics card.</p>
				
				<p><b>Security:</b> the NX Bit (No-eXectute Bit) is a hardware-based security feature found in Intel, AMD and ARM CPUs.
It marks certain areas of memory a “non-executable”, meaning code cannot run from those areas.
This helps prevent malware attacks (like buffer overflow attacks) by blocking malicious code from being executed in memory regions meant only for data.</p>
				<p>Each company’s name for NX Bit:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intel:	XD bit (eXecute Disable bit)</li>
					<li>AMD:	NX bit (No eXecute bit)</li>
					<li>ARM:	NX bit (Execute Never bit)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Main Purpose:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stops harmful code from running.</li>
					<li>Increases system protection without slowing down performance.</li>
				</ul>
