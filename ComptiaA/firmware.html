				Definition: firmware is a specialized, low-level software permanently programmed into a hardware device’s non-volatile memory ( like ROM, EEPROM or flash memory). It acts as a bridge between a computer’s hardware and its higher-level software (like the operating system).
Key characteristics:
    • stored on the device itself
    • non-volatile (retains data without power)
    • usually upgradable (e.g. BIOS/UEFI updates)
    • essential for hardware to function
Types of firmware
    • BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
        ◦ Legacy firmware stored in ROM or flash memory
        ◦ Initializes hardware and performs POST (Power-On Self Test)
        ◦ Uses text-based setup utility
        ◦ Has limitations (e.g., no support for drives larger than 2.2TB)
        ◦ Relies on MBR (Master Boot Record) for booting
    • UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
        ◦ Modern replacement for BIOS, with more advanced features:
            ▪ support for drives over 2.2 TB (uses GPT instead of MBR)
            ▪ mouse and GUI support
            ▪ secure boot (prevent unauthorized OS / software from loading)
            ▪ faster boot times
        ◦ Stored in flash memory on the motherboard
        ◦ Includes embedded diagnostics and recovery tools
MBR and GPT are two different partitioning schemes used to define how data is organized on a storage device (like a hard drive or SSD)
MBR (Master Boot Record)
    • introduced:1983
    • supports up to 4 primary partitions ( or 3 primary + 1 ext.)
    • supports up to 2 TB of disk space
    • stores bootloader in the first sector ( sector 0 ) of the disk
    • supported by most BIOS-based system
GPT (GUID Partition table)
    • introduced: as part of the UEFI standard
    • supports up to 128 primary partitions( in Windows)
    • supports disks larger than 2TB
    • stores multiple copies of the partition table for redundancy and uses CRC32 for integrity checking
    • required for booting from disks on UEFI-based systems; not supported on older BIOS-only-systems without special configuration
Key Firmware concept
POST (Power-On Self-Test)
    • run by the firmware to test essential components ( CPU, RAM, GPU, etc.)
    • fails generate beep codes or error messages
    • helps diagnose basic hardware issues before OS loads
POST cards: a small expansion card that plugs into the motherboard; displays hexadecimal Post codes during the startup sequence; helps identify the specific stage at which the system fails; useful when no beep codes or video output is available.
CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semicondutor) 
    • a battery -powered chip that stores system settings configured in BIOS/UEFI.
    • Examples of CMOS-stores data:
        ◦ Data and time
        ◦ Boot device order
        ◦ Enabled/disabled hardware
    • CMOS battery keeps settings when system is powered off.
    • If battery fails: settings reset to default.

System Setup Utility (BIOS/UEFI Setup)
    • accessed at boot ( common keys: DEL, F2, ESC, F10 )
    • used to:
        ◦ change boot order, enable/disable hardware, set system passwords, monitor temperatures and voltages, flash BIOS/UEFI updates.
Firmware Updates (Flashing)
    • Often done to fix bugs or add hardware support
    • can be risky (wrong update many “brick” the motherboard)
    • always use official update tools provided by motherboard manufacturer
BIOS/UEFI security – related options
    • Supervisor/Admin password: 
        ◦ restricts access to the BIOS/UEFI setup utility;
        ◦ prevents unauthorized changes to system configuration, boot order or overclocking system;
        ◦ must be entered before making any BIOS-level changes.
    • User/System password: 
        ◦ required to boot the system;
        ◦ acts as a pre-boot login, blocking access before the OS loads;
        ◦ can be used with or without an Admin password.
    • Drive Encryption/TPM(Trusted Platform Module):
        ◦ TPM is a hardware chip that stores encryption keys securely.
        ◦ Enables full-disk encryption using tools like Bitlocker (Windows).
        ◦ BIOS must have TPM enabled for these features to work.
        ◦ TPM can also store biometric or system authentication data.
    • Secure Boot:
        ◦ a UEFI feature that allows only digitally signed operating systems and bootloaders to run;
        ◦ protects against rootkits and boot-level malware;
        ◦ should be enabled for modern OS es like windows 10/11.
    • LoJack / Computrace:
        ◦ anti-theft technology embedded in BIOS firmware;
        ◦ allows tracking, remote lock, or data wipe if a device is lost/stolen;
        ◦ often used in enterprise laptops.
    • BIOS Flash Protection:
        ◦ prevents unauthorized updates (flashing) of BIOS/UEFI firmware;
        ◦ Protects against malware that tries to modify firmware (e.g. to insert persisten threats);
        ◦ May require Admin password or a jumper on the motherboard to override.
    • Chassis Intrusion Detections:
        ◦ some systems include a switch or sensor in the case.
        ◦ BIOS can log or alert if the case has been opened.
        ◦ Useful in security-sensitive environments.
    • Boot Sector Protection / Virus warning
        ◦ prevents programs from writing to the boot sector of the drive.
        ◦ Stops some malware from installing persistent boot-level code.
        ◦ May interfere with OS installations if not temporarily disabled.
Boot options and USB permissions in BIOS/UEFI
    • Boot Options (Boot Sequence / Boot Priority)
        ◦ define the order of devices the system checks for a bootable OS during startup.
        ◦ Common Boot Devices:
            ▪ Hard Drive/SSD, USB Flash Drive, CD/DVD Drive, Network(PXE Boot), External Drive.
        ◦ Why it’s important:
            ▪ You may need to boot from a USB or CD to install an OS or run diagnostics.
            ▪ Misconfigured boot order can prevent the system from starting properly.
    • USB Permissions / USB Configuration in BIOS
        ◦ control whether USB ports or USB boot devices are allowed during system startup.
        ◦ Security-related options:
            ▪ Enable/disable USB ports: block access to USB storage or peripherals to prevent data theft or malware.
            ▪ Enable/Disable USB Boot: prevents booting from unauthorized USB devices.
            ▪ USB Legacy Support: Allows USB devices to work with older Oses or boot enviroments.
        ◦ Why it matters:
            ▪ Disabling USB boot can prevent unauthorized users from booting into another OS or recovery environment.
            ▪ Disabling ports may be used in secure environments to reduce attack vectors.
The Boot Process: is the sequence of steps a computer follows from the moment it is powered on until the operating system is fully loaded and ready for use.
Steps in the Boot Process:
    1. Power On: the system receives power and begins hardware initialization.
    2. Post (Power-On-Self-Test): firmware (BIOS/UEFI) tests critical hardware like RAM, CPU and keyboard; errors may be indicated by beep codes or messages.
    3. BIOS/UEFI Configurations Load: Reads settings stored in CMOS (e.g., boot loader, data/time).
    4. Bootstrap Loader Execution: located in BIOS/UEFI, it identifies the bootable device; loads the OS bootloader (like BOOTMGR or GRUB) into RAM.
    5. Bootloader loads OS: the bootloader starts loading the operating system kernel from the selected device.
    6. Operating System Starts: the OS takes control, loads drivers, and presents the login or desktop screen.
Default/Optimized Settings:
    • Default Settings: basic, stable configurations for all hardware.
    • Optimized Defaults: pre-configured settings designed for best compatibility and performance.
    • When to use:
        ◦ after a failed overclock or BIOS error
        ◦ when troubleshotting hardware
        ◦ after clearing CMOS or replacing the motherboard
Clearing CMOS
    • Why clear CMOS?
        ◦ Reset forgotten BIOS passwords;
        ◦ fix boot or POST errors;
        ◦ revert unstable BIOS settings.
    • Almost every motherboard has a dedicated set of wires called CLRTC or similar
    • How to clear it:
        ◦ use CLEAR CMOS jumper on the motherboard
        ◦ or remove CMOS battery for 5-10 minutes;
        ◦ some boards have a Clear CMOS button;
    • After clearing, BIOS will reset to factory defaults
      
Losing CMOS/RTC settings
    • Causes:
        ◦ dead CMOS battery (typically CR2032 coin cell)
        ◦ manual clearing of CMOS
        ◦ power surge or failure
    • Symptoms:
        ◦ wrong date/time at startup
        ◦ boot device errors
        ◦ lost BIOS passwords or settings
    • Fix:
        ◦ replace the CMOS battery
        ◦ reconfigure BIOS setting
Flashing the ROM (Updating BIOS/UEFI)
    • flashing = writing a new version of firmware into the ROM chip (Firmware update)
    • Why flash?
        ◦ Fix bugs or vulnerabilities
        ◦ Add support for new hardware (CPU,RAM,SSDs)
        ◦ Improve stability or performance
    • How to flash
        ◦ download the correct BIOS from the manufacturer’s website
        ◦ use build-in tools like:
            ▪ EZ Flash, Q-Flash or M Flash
            ▪ DOS or USB-based utilities
    • Never interrupt power during flashing!
    • Risks:
        ◦ flashing the wrong version can brick the motherboard
        ◦ interruptions (like power loss) may leave BIOS unusable
