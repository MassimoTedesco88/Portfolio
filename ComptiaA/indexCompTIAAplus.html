				<h3>Thermal design power (TDP)</h3><p>is the maximum amount of heat a computer chip (like a CPU or GPU) is expected to generate undertypical workload conditions. It’s measured in watts and helps hardware designers choose appropriate cooling system to keep the chip operating safely and efficiently. (TDP is not the absolute maximum power the chip can use).</p>

				<p><b>Clock multipliers:</b> a clock multiplier is a factor used to determine the operating frequency of a CPU based on the base clock speed of the system.</p>
				<p>CPU speed = Base Clock x Multiplier</p>
				<p>3.6GHz = 100MHz x 36</p>
				<p><b>64-bit Processing:</b> refers to a CPU architecture that handles data in 64-bit chunks.</p> 
				<p>This allows for:</p>
   				<ul>
					<li>more memory access (up to 18.4 million TB of RAM theorically)</li>
					<li>better performance with large datasets</li> 
					<li>enhanced security features</li> 
   				</ul>
				<p><i>x86:</i> originally referred to Intel’s 32-bit processor architecture. Over time, it became a general label for 32-bit instruction set architectures used in PCs.</p>
				<p><i>x64:</i> 64-bit extension of x86.</p>
				<p><i>X86-64:</i>technical term for x64.</p>
				<p><b>Virtualization Support:</b> enables a CPU to run multiple operating systems simultaneously using virtual machines.</p>	
				<p><b>Parallel Execution:</b> refers to the ability of a CPU to execute multiple instructions or tasks at the same time, rather  than one after another.</p>
				<p><i>Pipeling:</i> is a technique where the CPU breaks down instruction execution into separate <i>stages</i>, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously – one in each stage.</p>
				<p>This boosts instructions through put.</p>
				<p><i>Stages:</i></p>
				<ol>
					<li><i>Fetch:</i> get the data from the EDB</li>
					<li><i>Decode:</i> figure out what type of command needs to be executed</li>
					<li><i>Execute:</i> perform the calculation</li>
					<li><i>Write:</i> send the data back on to the EDB</li>
				</ol>
				<p><i>Cache:</i> is a small, fast memory inside or near the CPU that stores copies of frequently used data from the main memory (RAM), helping the CPU access important information much faster.</p>
				<p><i>Threads:</i> a thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a program.
				Multiple threads can run parts of a program at the same time, allowing tasks to happen faster and more efficiently.</p>
				<p><i>Wait states:</i> a wait state is a short delay that occurs when the CPU has to wait for data from slower devices like RAM or storage.
				While waiting, the CPU temporarily pauses because it cannot continue processing without the required information.</p>
				<p>L1, L2, L3 Cache</p>
				<ul><li>L1 Cache: Smallest and fastest cache, built directly into the CPU core. Stores critical data and instructions needed immediately.</li> 
					<li>L2 Cache: Larger than L1 Cache but a bit slower. Acts as a backup for L1, holding more data.</li>
					<li>L3 Cache: Even larger and slower compared to L1 and L2. Shared across multiple cores to improve communication between them.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><i>Multithreading:</i> is the general concept where a CPU( or a program) handles multiple threads at the same time to improve performance.</p>
				<p><i>Hyper-Threading:</i> is Intel’s brand name for a special type of multithreading where one physical CPU core acts like two logical cores. It lets a single core process two threads simultaneously to better use CPU resources and increase speed.</p>
				<p><b>Multicore processing:</b> means a CPU has two or more independent cores inside a single chip. Each core can run its own tasks or threads at the same time, which makes the CPU much faster and better at multitasking compared ti a single-core processor.</p>
				<p><b>Integrated memory controller (IMC):</b> is a memory controller that is built directly into the CPU instead of being a separate chip on the motherboard.
It manages communication between the CPU and the system’s RAM, making data transfer faster and more efficient by reducing latency.</p>
				<p><b>Integrated graphics processing unit (iGPU):</b> is a graphics processor built into the CPU (or sometimes into the motherboard chipset). It handles basic graphics tasks like video playback, webbrowsing, and light gaming without needing a separate (dedicated) graphics card.</p>
				
				<p><b>Security:</b> the NX Bit (No-eXectute Bit) is a hardware-based security feature found in Intel, AMD and ARM CPUs.
It marks certain areas of memory a “non-executable”, meaning code cannot run from those areas.
This helps prevent malware attacks (like buffer overflow attacks) by blocking malicious code from being executed in memory regions meant only for data.</p>
				<p>Each company’s name for NX Bit:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intel:	XD bit (eXecute Disable bit)</li>
					<li>AMD:	NX bit (No eXecute bit)</li>
					<li>ARM:	NX bit (Execute Never bit)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Main Purpose:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stops harmful code from running.</li>
					<li>Increases system protection without slowing down performance.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>When installing a CPU</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Not bend any of the tiny pins on the CPU or the socket.</li>
					<li>The power supply can supply enough electricity for the CPU.</li>
					<li>Provide adeguate cooling.</li>				
				</ul>
				<h3>CPU Socket types:</h3>
				<ul><li>Intel CPUs uses a Land Grid Array (LGA) package for socketed CPUs, where the underside of the CPU has hundred of contact points that line up with the socket pins.</li>
					<li>AMD CPUs have the pins; the sockets have holes. The pins on the AMD Pin Grid Array (PGA) CPUs allign with the holes in the sockets.</li>
					<li>These sockets are generically called zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets.</li>
				</ul>	
				<h3>Cooling</h3>
				<ul>
						<li> CPUs consume wattage or watts</li>
						<li> CPUs don’t tolerate heat well</li>
						<li> CPU usesa a combination of a heat sink and fan.</li>
						<li> A heat sink is a copper or other metal device designed to dissipate heat from whatever it touches.</li>
						<li> A heatsink by itself (no fan) on a chip provides passive cooling.</li>
						<li> A heatsink and fan combination provides active cooling.</li>
						<li> <i>OEM CPU coolers:</i> original equipment manufacturer (OEM) heat-sink and fan assemblies are included with most Intel  and AMD retail-boxed CPUs. - PRO: you know absolutely they will work with your CPU.</li>
						<li> <i>Spezialized CPU coolers:</i> many companies sell third-party heat-sink and fan assemblies for a variety of CPUs.</li>
						<li> <i>Liquid cooling:</i> works by running some liquid (usually water). Any liquid-cooling system consists of three main parts:</li>
							<ul><li>a hollow metal block that sits on the CPU</li>
								<li>a pump to move the liquid around</li>
								<li>some device to cool the liquid</li>
							</ul>        
						<li> before inserting the heat sink, add a small amount of thermal paste ( also called: thermal compound, heat dope, nasty silver goo).</li>
						<li> secure heat sink and plug the fan power connectore into the motherboard standout.</li>
				</ul>		
    			<h3>Overclocking</h3> <p>running a CPU or GPU faster than its official speed to boost performance.</p>
				<h4>CMOS clear or CLRTC:</h4>
				<p> most motherboards have a jumper setting or a button that makes the CMOS go back to default setting.</p>
				<h2>Troubleshooting CPUs</h2>
				<ol>
					<li> Overheating</li>
					<li> Catastrophic failures</li>				
				</ol>
				<h3>Symptoms of Overheating:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> too much thermal paste</li>
					<li> not enough thermal paste or thermal paste spread unevenly</li>
					<li> failure to connect the fan power</li>
				</ul>
    
				<p>If CPU doesn’t have adequate ventilation = this will result in sluggish performance ( the CPU slow down to minimize heat), intermittent shutdowns ( when the CPU hits a certain thermal level) or spontaneously rebooting.</p>

				<h3>Catastrophic Failures:</h3>
				<p>The PC will suddenly get a blue screen of death ( BsoD), what’s technically called a Windows Stop Error.</p>
				<p><b>--						OR						--</b></p>
				<p>The entire computer will simply STOP and the screen will go black, perhaps accomanied by a loud pop.</p>
				<ul>
					<li> The acrid smell of burnt electronics</li>
					<li> trails of smoke coming out of the case</li>
				</ul>
