DRAM	Dynamic RAM	Mainsystem memory	Slower than SRAM, need refreshing
SDRAM	Synchronous DRAM	Old Computers (~1990s)	Synced (synchronized) with CPU clock 
DDR SDRAM	Double Data Rate SDRAM	Modern PCs	Transfers data on both clock edges
DDR2/DDR3/DDR4/DDR5	Faster versions of DDR	Modern desktops, laptops, servers	Increasing speed and efficiency over generations
VRAM	Video RAM	Graphics cards (GPU)	Specialized for image data
LPDDR	Low-power DDR	Smartphones, tablets	Battery-efficient RAM
ECC RAM	Error- correcting code ram	Servers, workstations	Can detect and correct memory errors

Common RAM Modules
Module Type	Full name	Where Used	Key Features
DIMM	Dual Inline Memory Module	Desktops, Servers	Full-size RAM, 168-288pins
SO-DIMM	Small Outline DIMM	Laptops, Small PCs	Half-size of DIMM, 72-260pins
RDIMM	Registered DIMM	Servers	With register between DRAM and memory controller for stability
LRDIMM	Load-Registered DIMM	High-end servers	Lower electrical load, higher capacity
UDIMM	Unbuffered DIMM	Desktops, some servers	Regular, unbuffered RAM (no register)
Micro DIMM	Micro Dual Inline Memory Module	Ultra-small laptops	Even smaller than SO-DIMM
A desktop usually has DIMMs.
A laptop uses SO-DIMMs.
A server can use RDIMMs or LRDIMMs.

Number of Pins of DDR RAM
DDR Version	DIMM (Desktop)	SO-DIMM(Laptop)
DDR1	184 pins	200 pins
DDR2	240 pins	200 pins
DDR3	240 pins	204 pins
DDR4	288 pins	260 pins
DDR5	288 pins	262 pins
Types of Memory Channel Architecture
Architecture	Number of slots	How to populate	Where it’s used
Single Channel	1,2,4	Insert 1 RAM stick in any slot	Entry-level PCs, old laptops
Dual Channel	2 or 4	Insert 2 RAM sticks in paired slots (e.g. A1+B1)	Most modern desktops and laptops
Triple Channel	3 or 6	Insert 3 RAM sticks in specific slots	Old high-end Intel x58 platforms
Quad Channel	4 or 8	Insert 4 RAM sticks in correct pairs (e.g. A1+B1+A2+B2)	Workstations, HEDT (High-End Desktop) CPUs like Threadripper, Xeon
Important summary:
    • Number of slots available ≠ number of channels ( you might have 4 slots, but still only support dual channel)
    • To enable multi-channel ( Dual-Triple-Quad):
        ◦ you must insert RAM sticks properly according to the motherboard manual.
        ◦ Often, slots are color-coded to help you.
    • Mixing different RAM sizes or models can cause memory to run in single channel or asymmetric mode, lowering performance.
    • More channel = more memory bandwidth

DDR3/DDR4/DDR5 Speed Comparison Table
Key terms:
Core RAM Clock: Real clock speed of the memory chip.
I/O Bus Clock (MT/s): Mega transfers per second – shows how fast data is transferred.
PC Speed Rating: Label used on RAM modules.
Bandwidth: Maximum data transfer rate per memory channel ( in ideal conditions).
Important Notes about DDR3/DDR4/DDR5 RAM
    • MT/s ≠ Mhz : DDR memory transfers two data bits per clock cycle.
        ◦ Therefore:
            ▪ 1600 Mhz I/O = 800 Mhz real core clock
            ▪ MT/s = mega transfer per second
    • How I/O speeds relate to clock speeds:
        ◦ DDR2: I/O speed = 2x the internal clock
        ◦ DDR3/DDR4/DDR5=
            ▪ I/O speed = 4x the internal clock.
            ▪ Use techniques like 8-bit prefetch, making I/O speed effectively 4x the clock
    • PC Speed Rating = MT/s x 8 : this number represents the theorical maximum bandwidth in MB/s
        ◦ example: DDR3-1600 = 1600 x 8 = PC3-12800
    • Compatibility:
        ◦ DDR3,DDR4,DDR5 are not physucally or electrically compatible
        ◦ Each generation uses a different number of pins and different NOTCH position
    • Channel and total bandwidth
        ◦ bandwidth refers to single-channel
        ◦ with dual-channel, bandwidth doubles
    • Different Voltage requirements:
RAM Type	Typical voltage
DDR3	1.5V (low-voltage:1.35V or 1.25V)
DDR4	1.2V
DDR5	1.1V (with onboard power management)
    • DDR5: Integrated PMIC
        ◦ DDR5 includes a Power Management IC (PMIC) built directly into the memory module, instead of relying on the motherboard. This improves stability but increases complexity and cost
    • Real-Word speeds ≠ Theoretical speeds
        ◦ real performance also depends on:
            ▪ latency (CL)
            ▪ CPU memory controller
            ▪ system architecture

RAM variations:
    • Double-Sided DIMM: these RAM sticks have memory chips on both sides of the module. They may be treated by the system as two ranks, which can affect compatibility and performance.
    • Latency (CAS Latency – CL): Latency is the delay between a memory request and the response. Lower CL = faster response time
    • Registered and Buffered memory:
        ◦ Registered (RDIMM): has a register between the memory controller and the DRAM chips. It improves stability for servers and workstations.
        ◦ Buffered: a general term, often the same as registered.
        ◦ Unbuffered (UDIMM): regular RAM used in desktops/laptops. It’s faster but less stable for large memory configurations.
Do you need more RAM?
Two symptoms point:
    • general system sluggishness and excessive hard drive accessing.
Virtual Memory: is a section of a computer’s storage (usually the hard drive or SSD) that acts like extra RAM when the physical RAM is full.
    • It prevents crashes when RAM runs out
    • It’s much slower than real RAM
    • Managed automatically by the operating system (e.g. Windows Page file, Linux Swap)
Simple explanation of how virtual memory works:
    1. RAM Get Full: when your system runs many programs or opens large files, the physical RAM fills up
    2. OS creates a Page file ( or Swap space): the operating system uses a section of your hard drive or SSD as temporary memory – this is called: Page File (windows) and Swap Space (linux/macOs)
    3. Less-Used Data is moved: the OS moves inactive data (like background apps or old tabs) from RAM to the virtualo memory on disk
    4. RAM is freed up: now RAM has space for active tasks, like your current game or browser window
    5. If needed, Data is swapped back: when that old data is needed again, it’s moved back from disk to RAM – but this takes time, making the system feel slower
System RAM recommendation:
32 bit Windows (8/8.1/10)	2 GB to get by	4 GB for best result
64 bit Windows(8/8.1/10/11)	8 GB to get by	16 GB for a solid machine;
32 GB for any machine doing serious, processor-intensive work.

Determining current RAM capacity
(System Control Panel applet or windows-pause/break) 
(Task manager by pressing CTRL-SHIFT-ESC )

Getting the right RAM
    1. Open the case to see how many sticks of RAM you have installed currently and how many free slots you have open
    2. Check the motherboard book or RAM manufacturer’s website to determine the total capacity of RAM the system can handle and what specific technology works with your system
    3. Find oyt what DDR generation (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5) they support
or 
use the freeware CPU-Z program.

Mixing
    • All motherboards can handle different capacities if RAM. (If you have three slots, you may put a 4GB stick in one and an 8 GB stick in the other with a high chance of success)
    • to ensure maximum stability in a system: Choose RAM sticks that match in technology, capacity, speed and latency (CL)
    • The safest, easiest rule to follow is to use the speed of DRAM specified in the motherboard book and make sure that every piece of DRAM runs at that speed.

Installing DIMMs / SoDIMMs
    1. attach an antistatic wrist strap ( to avoid ESD)
    2. on a laptop, turn the system off, disconnect it from the AC wall socket and remove all batteries
    3. if you are working on a laptop with a build-in battery, consult the service manual and look for a “service mode” procedure >>> this mode will cut off power from the installed battery, making the laptop safe to work on
Troubleshooting RAM
Common RAM issues symptoms
    • frequent crashes or blue screens (BSOD – Blue screen of death)
    • PC won’t boot or reboot randomly
    • beeping sounds during startup
    • programs freeze or close unexpectedly
    • wrong RAM amount shown in system info
Steps to trobleshoot RAM
    1. Check physical installation
        ◦ power off PC, unplug it, and re-seat the RAM modules
        ◦ clean the slots and contacts with compressed air
        ◦ make sure they’re clicked in fully and in the right slots
    2.  Use one stick at a time
        ◦ remove all but one RAM stick and try booting
        ◦ test each stick individually in each slot to find faulty ones
        ◦ 
    3. Run memory diagnostic tools
        ◦ windows memory diagnostic: Type “MDSCHED” in start menu and restart to test
        ◦ MemTest86: Boot from USB and scan memory throughly
    4. Check BIOS Settings
        ◦ reset BIOS/UEFI to default setting
        ◦ update BIOS if newer versions improve memory compatibility
    5. Check compatibility
        ◦ ensure your RAM’s speed, size, and type are supported by the motherboard
        ◦ mixing different RAM kits can sometimes cause instability

    • if RAM is faulty:
        ◦ replace the defective stick
        ◦ if under warranty, contact the manufacturer for RMA (replacement)
