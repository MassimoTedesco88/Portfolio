		<h1>Automated Stock Analysis Tool</h1>
		
					<p><i>Personal Project | Feb 2025 â€“ Apr 2025 (Evenings & Weekends)</i></p>
					<p>I developed a Python-based stock analysus program that leverages the Financial Modeling Prep API to analyze up to 250 tickers per day (free API tier). </p>
					<p class="red"><b>This project was developed using Python with the support of AI tools such as ChatGPT to assist in coding. I focused on designing the system, defining its logic, and integrating the various components while learning through the development process.</b></p>
					<p><b>Current Status & Future Plans:</b></p>
					<p>The project is currently on hold as I focus on studying for the CompTIA A+ certification.</p>
					<p><b>Planned future improvements include:</b></p>
					
						<p>Adding English-language signal outputs,</p>
						<p>Implementing a new backtesting module featuring maximum drawdown, win rate, and loss rate calculations;</p>
						<p>Developing a web platform that automatically publishes all HTML reports online;</p>
						<p>Integrating a user login system, where only registered users can access the reports.</p>

							<h2>What I learned</h2>
							<p>Through this project, I improved my skills in data automation, financial analysis, and report generation. I learned how to implement and combine different types of market indicators, manage and structure large amounts of data, and create a system for tracking and comparing investment opportunities.</p>

							<h2>Why I built it</h2>
							<p>I wanted to deepen my understanding of financial markets while improving my programming skills by building a tool that automates investment analysis. The goal was to create something practical that could identify high-potential opportunities across different time horizons.</p>
