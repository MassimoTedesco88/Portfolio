				<p>I developed a Python-based stock analysus program that leverages the Financial Modeling Prep API to analyze up to 250 tickers per day (free API tier). </p>
				<p>The tool performs the following key functions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Data Acquisition:</b> Automatically downloads historical prices and financial data for selected tickers.</li>
						<li><b>Analysis & Indicators:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Calculates technical, fundamental, and sentiment indicators.</li>
								<li>Benchmarks each asset against global market conditions.</li>
								<li>Detects the current market phase (e.g., accumulation, distribution).</li>
								<li>Estimates investment horizon and automatically sets entry price, take profit, and stop loss levels.</li>
								<li>Assesses risk and investment attractiveness.</li>
								<li>Provides commentary in Italian on detected signals and suggests buying opportunities for short, medium, or long-term strategies.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Reporting & Strategy:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>Generates interactive HTML reports and CSV files for each analysis.</li>
								<li>Clickable links open detailed reports for each analyzed ticker.</li>
								<li>Ranks and lists the top investment candidates using two custom strategies based on defined indicators and performance thresholds.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="red"><b>This project was developed using Python with the support of AI tools such as ChatGPT to assist in coding. I focused on designing the system, defining its logic, and integrating the various components while learning through the development process.</b></p>
					<p><b>Current Status & Future Plans:</b></p>
					<p>The project is currently on hold as I focus on studying for the CompTIA A+ certification.</p>
					<p>Planned future improvements include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Adding English-language signal outputs.</li>
						<li>Implementing a new backtesting module featuring maximum drawdown, win rate, and loss rate calculations.</li>
						<li>Developing a web platform that automatically publishes all HTML reports online.</li>
						<li>Integrating a user login system, where only registered users can access the reports.</li>
					</ul>
