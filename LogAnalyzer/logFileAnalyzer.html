		<h1>System Log Analyzer for Local Security</h1>
		<p>
			A lightweight Python tool developed to analyze system logs on Linux(Ubuntu), with the goal of detecting potential intrusions, unauthorized login attemps, and suspicious activity.
			The script inspects key security-related events by querying system logs via journalctl.

		</p>
		<p><b>Note: The code in this project was written with the help of ChatGPT.</b></p>	
		<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
		<p><i>Linux (journalctl), Python, shell scripting</i></p>
		<h2>Why I built it</h2>
		<p>I wanted to improve my understanding of Linux system auditing and learn how to programmatically detect early signs of unauthorized access or misuse. This project allowed me to explore log analysis and implement basic security monitoring techniques using native system tools.</p>

				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<ul>
				    <li>Scans system logs from recent days using journalctl</li>
				    <li>Detects suspicious events such as:</li><ul>
						<li>Failed login attempts</li>
						<li>Login attempts by non-existent users</li>
						<li>Sessions started by unknown or untrusted accounts</li>
						<li>Improper use of administrative privileges</li>
   				    </ul>
				</ul>

    			<h2>What I learned</h2>
    			<p>This project helped me improve my ability to analyze system logs and extract meaningful patterns related to security. I focused on identifying suspicious authentication behaviors and defining criteria to detect potential threats. It also strengthened my skills in scripting, log parsing, and designing simple rule-based detection logic.</p>
