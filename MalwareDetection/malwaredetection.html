		<h1>Python Tool to detect Suspicious Processes</h1>
		<p>A Python-based system diagnostic and security tool that scans all active processes on a local machine, computes the SHA-256 hash of each executable, and checks it against a live malware hash feed from Abuse.ch.
The program extracts system hardware information (CPU,RAM), logs top resource-consuming processes, and saves all results to CSV and log files in the user's Documents folder.
It implements threat comparison logic with a local hash database, automatically updated monthly, ensuring fast and offline-ready performance. Built using psutil and hashlib, the tool demonstrates secure file handling, process introspection, and real-world integration of open threat intelligence - without requiring any user registration or third-party API keys.</p>
		<p><b>Note: The code in this project was written with the help of ChatGPT.</b></p>	
		<h2>Technologies used</h2>
		<p><i>Python, psutil, hashlib</i></p>
		<h2>Why I built it</h2>
		<p>I wanted to experiment with basic malware detection techniques by creating a simple tool that scans active processes and verifies their integrity using known malware hashes. The goal was to build something lightweight that could be used for quick local checks without relying on full antivirus suites.</p>

				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Scans all running processes on the system</li>
					<li>Calculates the SHA-256 hash of each process executable</li>
					<li>Compares each hash against a known malware hash list</li>
					<li>Saves the scan results to CSV and log files inside the user's Document folder</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>What I learned</h2>
				<p>Through this project, I improved my skills in process inspection, hashing techniques, and file handling in Python. I also learned how to structure simple security utilities that interact safely with system resources and present results in a clear, exportable format.</p>
