		<h1>Suspicious Port & Malware Process Scanner</h1>
		<p>NetSentinel is a Python-based security tool that monitors active network connections on a Linux system and detects potentially malicious processes based on their behavior and knows malware fingerprints. Given a list of suspicious ports, it scans all current TCP/UDP connections using the ss command, identifies associated processes, and analyzes their binary executable. It computes the SHA256 hash of each process and checks it against a known database of malicious hashes.</p>
		<p><b>Note: The code in this project was written with the help of ChatGPT.</b></p>	
		<h2>Technologies used</h2>
		<p><i>Python, psutil, subprocess, ss</i></p>
		<h2>Why I built it</h2>
		<p>I wanted to explore network security and low-level system monitoring by creating a tool that helps detect suspicious or malicious processes through automated scanning and hash-based verification. It was also an opportunity to improve my skills in system-level scripting and threat detection.</p>

				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<ul>
				    <li>Scans system connections via ss -tunap</li>
				    <li>Maps connections to associated process IDs and executables</li>
				    <li>Computes SHA256 hash of each binary and compares it with a known malware hash list</li>
				    <li>Displays process owner, command path, and hash status</li>
				</ul>

    			<h2>What I learned</h2>
    			<p>This project helped me understand how to interact with the operating system to extract low-level network and process data. I gained experience with secure hashing techniques, process-to-connection mapping, and integrating threat intelligence sources into security tools.</p>
