		<h1>Suspicious Port & Malware Process Scanner</h1>
		<p>NetSentinel is a Python-based security tool that monitors active network connections on a Linux system and detects potentially malicious processes based on their behavior and knows malware fingerprints. Given a list of suspicious ports, it scans all current TCP/UDP connections using the ss command, identifies associated processes, and analyzes their binary executable. It computes the SHA256 hash of each process and checks it against a known database of malicious hashes.</p>

				<h3>Key Features</h3>
				<ul>
				    <li>Scans system connections via ss -tunap</li>
				    <li>Maps connections to associated process IDs and executables</li>
				    <li>Computes SHA256 hash of each binary and compares it with a known malware hash list</li>
				    <li>Displays process owner, command path, and hash status</li>
				</ul>
