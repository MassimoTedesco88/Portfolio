		<h1>Network Scanner & Connection Analyzer</h1>
		<p>This Python-based tool performs an in-depth scan of a local network by identifying connected devices, analyzing open ports, and mapping active network connections. It leverages the psutil library to retrieve real-time information about network sockets and associated system processes.</p>
		<p><b>Note: The code in this project was written with the help of ChatGPT.</b></p>

				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<ul>
				    <li>Automatic detection of devices on the local subnet</li>
				    <li>Detailed listing of active TCP/UDP connections with local and remote IPs and ports</li>
				    <li>Identification of services/processes associated with each connection</li>
				    <li>Recognition of ephemeral (temporary) ports to distinguish client-side connections</li>
   				    <li>Basic security insights to help indentify unusual or suspicious network activity</li>
				</ul>

    			<h2>Why I build it</h2>
				<p>I wanted to better understand how local networks operate and how to detect unusual activity by building a tool for real-time network monitoring. The goal was to create a lightweight utility that could provide visibility  into all active connections and help identify potential security issues on a local subnet.</p>

    			<h2>What I learned</h2>
    			<p>This project enhanced my understanding of networking concepts such as port scanning, socket communication, and process-to-connection mapping. I also learned how to differentiate between normal and potentially suspicious traffic patterns, and how to extract meaningful security insights from low-level network data.</p>
